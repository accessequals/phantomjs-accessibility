# phantomjs-accessibility

## Running the tests
1. Install PhantomJS.
2. Clone these tests: git clone https://github.com/accessequals/phantomjs-accessibility.git
3. Run them with a command in this format: phantomjs [test script] [site]

##Notes:
# multi-test.js combines two tests and outputs the results to the console and 
to a log file. The exists test for the log file needs attention.
# If you use a file as a template, please use one like 'list-headings.js' which
contains error handling.
# Comments are preceded by two forward slashes
# Please create a branch: git checkout -b branch-name. Then push that branch only to the remote: git push -u origin branch-name.
